            <p>I love the fact that I get to lead teams of people through the philosophy of human-centered design,
                design thinking, and product development. I also deliver experience design and strategy that meet the
                desires of our customers, the feasibility of our development teams, and the viability of the business. I
                currently work and play from Madison (Wisconsin), though I am used to working onsite or virtually with a
                wide variety of teams across diverse geographies.</p>

            <!--Books-->
            <p>I'm an avid reader. I love to learn more about my profession, design, human behavior, self-improving
                myself, and helping others. One of my favorite books is Orbiting the Gaint Hairball by Gordon MacKenzie.

            <!--Outdoors-->
            <p>Apart from work, I love the outdoors. Just this year alone, I will have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Snowboarded in Vail, local parks, and the many “hills” of WI and the UP</li>
                <li>Kayaked the Wisconsin River on a 3-night trip (love the sandbars)</li>
                <li>Car-camped across the great state of Wisconsin too many times to count</li>
                <li>Thru-hiked 125 miles of the upper Ice Age Trail</li>
                <li>Trained for my second Ironman distance race in September ‘22 </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pb-3">I enjoy sharing my outdoor experiences with my family and friends. We’ve had many adventures
                over the years that have helped me be a better person. Here is a glimpse into some of <a

                    adventures.</a></p>
            <!--Army-->
            <p>Another fun fact about me; I enlisted at the age of 17 into the United States Army and served one tour of
                duty (OIF) in 2003. While in a war zone, my contributions and performance earned me a retroactive
                promotion (battlefield promotions weren’t reinstated until 2009) to a non-commissioned officer. And yes,
                I used camo paint to draw flames on my truck in the middle of Iraq.</p>
