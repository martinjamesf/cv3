            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>As a Design Leader with expertise in human-centered service design, advanced design thinking, and
                user experience strategy, I have successfully led teams in creating digital experiences across
                finance, insurance, medical devices, fitness equipment, marketing, and advertising industries.
                My approach ensures that solutions are not only user-centric, but also strategically aligned
                with business objectives and development feasibility.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>My Core Strengths:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leadership & Team Development –</strong> Coaching teams in design-thinking
                    methodologies, fosteringinnovation, and aligning efforts toward strategic business goals.
                </li>
                <li>User Experience & Product Design –</strong> Applying insights from Human-Centered Service
                    Design (HCD)and Advanced Design Thinking to craft seamless, research-driven user
                    experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems-Thinking & Strategy –</strong> Driving operational improvements and
                    advocating for scalable,user-first solutions across complex organizations.
                <li><strong>Presentation & Workshop Facilitation –</strong> Leading design sprints, workshops,
                    and executivepresentations to communicate the value of design.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual & Motion Design –</strong> Leveraging graphic design, motion/video editing,
                    and front-end experiences to create engaging, high-impact experiences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With my User Experience Certification (UXC), I deliver validated user experiences with user
                research, design strategy, and systems-thinking methodologies. Beyond delivering digital product
                solutions, I am a curious intrapreneur who thrives on solving problems through creative
                solutions. My ability to bridge design, business strategy, and development has allowed me to
                drive meaningful impact within
                organizations.</p>
            <p>Additionally, my military experience has sharpened my leadership skills, resilience, and ability
                to focus on what truly matters—fostering collaboration, empowering others, and driving results
                in fast-paced environments.</p>
            <p>Let’s set up a time to discuss how I can contribute to your team. When would be a good time for
                us to connect?</p>
            <p>I love the fact that I get to lead teams of people through the philosophy of human-centered design,
                design thinking, and product development. I also deliver experience design and strategy that meet the
                desires of our customers, the feasibility of our development teams, and the viability of the business. I
                currently work and play from Madison (Wisconsin), though I am used to working onsite or virtually with a
                wide variety of teams across diverse geographies.</p>

            <!--Books-->
            <p>I'm an avid reader. I love to learn more about my profession, design, human behavior, self-improving
                myself, and helping others. One of my favorite books is Orbiting the Gaint Hairball by Gordon MacKenzie.

            <!--Outdoors-->
            <p>Apart from work, I love the outdoors. Just this year alone, I will have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Snowboarded in Vail, local parks, and the many “hills” of WI and the UP</li>
                <li>Kayaked the Wisconsin River on a 3-night trip (love the sandbars)</li>
                <li>Car-camped across the great state of Wisconsin too many times to count</li>
                <li>Thru-hiked 125 miles of the upper Ice Age Trail</li>
                <li>Trained for my second Ironman distance race in September ‘22 </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pb-3">I enjoy sharing my outdoor experiences with my family and friends. We’ve had many adventures
                over the years that have helped me be a better person. Here is a glimpse into some of <a
                    style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZuW1QAiBQ76i64R8A">my outdoor
                    adventures.</a></p>
            <!--Army-->
            <p>Another fun fact about me; I enlisted at the age of 17 into the United States Army and served one tour of
                duty (OIF) in 2003. While in a war zone, my contributions and performance earned me a retroactive
                promotion (battlefield promotions weren’t reinstated until 2009) to a non-commissioned officer. And yes,
                I used camo paint to draw flames on my truck in the middle of Iraq.</p>
